# The purpose of this file is to define all of the NetworkLinks (i.e. layer 1
# devices) and Networks (i.e. layer 3 configurations). The following is standard
# for the logical networks in Airship:
#
# +----------+-----------------------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
# | Network  |                                   | Per-rack or    |              |   VLAN tagged   |
# |   Name   |             Purpose               | per-site CIDR? | Has gateway? |  or untagged?   |
# +----------+-----------------------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
# |   oob    | Out of Band devices (iDrac/iLo)   | per-site CIDR  | Has gateway  | Untagged/Native |
# |   pxe    | PXE boot network                  | per-site CIDR  | No gateway   | Untagged/Native |
# |   oam    | management network                | per-site CIDR  | Has gateway  |     tagged      |
# | storage  | storage network                   | per-site CIDR  | No gateway   |     tagged      |
# |  calico  | underlay calico net; k8s traffic  | per-site CIDR  | No gateway   |     tagged      |
# | overlay  | overlay network for openstack SDN | per-site CIDR  | No gateway   |     tagged      |
# +----------+-----------------------------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------+
#
# For standard Airship deployments, you should not need to modify the number of
# NetworkLinks and Networks in this file. Only the IP addresses and CIDRs should
# need editing.
#
# TODO: Given that we expect all network broadcast domains to span all racks in
# Airship, we should choose network names that do not include the rack number.
